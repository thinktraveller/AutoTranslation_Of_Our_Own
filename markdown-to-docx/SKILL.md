# Skill: Markdown to DOCX

Use this skill when the user wants `.md` files exported to `.docx` with `pandoc`.

## What this skill does

- Converts one Markdown file or all top-level Markdown files in a directory.
- Creates one `.docx` per source `.md`.
- Preserves images by setting a broad `--resource-path`.
- Normalizes Obsidian image embeds like `![[image.png]]` and `![[image.png|697]]` before conversion.
- Repairs the common case where a figure caption and an Obsidian image were accidentally merged onto one line.
- Can render Markdown against a Word `.dotx`/`.docx` reference template and apply post-processing for polished Word output.
- Renders Mermaid code blocks to PNG images when Node.js and `npx` are available.

## Workflow

1. Confirm `pandoc` is installed with `pandoc --version`.
2. Inspect the source folder for Markdown files and image syntax if needed.
3. Run the bundled script from this skill folder:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="/path/to/markdown-to-docx"
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/convert_markdown_to_docx.sh" \
  "<source-path>" \
  "<output-dir>" \
  "[resource-root]"
```

## Parameters

- `source-path`: a single `.md` file or a directory that contains `.md` files.
- `output-dir`: destination directory for generated `.docx` files.
- `resource-root` (optional): root directory that contains shared assets such as `resources/`. If omitted, the script infers likely roots from the source location.

## Template Workflow

When the user provides a Word template:

### Step 1: Convert (auto-fixes captions)

The conversion script **automatically inserts missing table/figure captions** into the normalized markdown before calling pandoc. No manual pre-check is needed — the pipeline:

1. Normalizes Obsidian embeds and markdown syntax
2. Runs `validate_captions.py fix` to auto-insert any missing `表N-M` / `图N-M` captions (derived from table headers or surrounding context)
3. Converts with pandoc + Lua style filter
4. Post-processes the docx (fonts, styles, tables, borders, headers)

You can still run a manual pre-check to preview what will be fixed:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="/path/to/markdown-to-docx"
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/validate_captions.py" \
  pre "<source-md>"
```

```bash
SKILL_DIR="/path/to/markdown-to-docx"
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/render_markdown_with_dotx.sh" \
  "<source-md>" \
  "<output-docx>" \
  "<template-dotx-or-docx>" \
  "[book-title]" \
  "[resource-root]" \
  "[shortcut-template]"
```

This script automatically:

- Auto-inserts missing `表N-M` / `图N-M` captions (derived from table headers or surrounding context)
- Maps image blocks, figure/table captions to publisher paragraph styles via Lua filter
- Post-processes for code style, fonts (Times New Roman + 宋体), table borders, layout
- Rewrites unordered-list indentation so bullet text aligns with Chinese paragraph first-line indent instead of Word's default deep indent
- Rewrites ordered and unordered lists so the marker column aligns with the Chinese body paragraph's two-character first-line indent instead of drifting too far left
- Applies Word `keep with next` to image paragraphs and table captions so images stay with figure captions and captions stay with tables
- Removes the code-block first-line indent from the exported `Source Code` paragraph style
- Clears first-line indent inside every table cell paragraph so table content does not inherit body-text indentation
- Replaces header text with chapter title
- Suppresses template auto-numbering when headings already contain explicit chapter numbers
- Extracts figure explanations and shortens captions for editor style
- Optionally injects Word shortcut bindings from the original `.dotx` template
- Automatically preserves Word shortcut bindings when the provided template already contains `word/customizations.xml`

### Step 2: Post-check — validate generated docx

```bash
SKILL_DIR="/path/to/markdown-to-docx"
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/validate_captions.py" \
  post "<output-docx>"
```

This checks:
1. No `Compact` style paragraphs (undefined style)
2. No VML horizontal rules (`o:hr="t"`)
3. Font defaults = Times New Roman + 宋体 (not Calibri)
4. First-line indent present in Normal style
5. All tables have borders (tblBorders or tcBorders)
6. Image paragraphs (`图`) and table captions (`表题1-1`) have `keep with next`
7. Code block style has no first-line indent
8. Ordered and unordered list geometry keeps the marker column aligned with Chinese paragraph first-line indent
9. Table cell paragraphs explicitly clear first-line indent
10. Table captions (表X-Y) present and sequentially numbered
11. Figure captions (图X-Y) present and sequentially numbered

**If post-check reports ERRORs, investigate and fix.** The most common post-check error is missing captions — which means the markdown source was missing them (go back to Step 1).

Current editorial rules are tracked in:

## Notes

- The script only converts top-level `.md` files when a directory is passed.
- Source Markdown files are not modified. Normalization happens in a temporary directory.
- If the user wants recursive conversion, patch the script first instead of reimplementing the workflow ad hoc.
- If the publisher template contains `word/customizations.xml`, the render script now auto-injects those keymap customizations into the generated `.docx`. You can still pass an explicit `shortcut-template` when the shortcut source differs from the reference template.
- **MANDATORY**: Always run post-check after conversion. Never skip validation. Caption auto-fix runs automatically during conversion.
